<abstract>LandsNet - Land Resources Division (LRD)NPS Director's Order #25 states: &amp;quot;Land status maps will be prepared to identify the ownership of the lands within the authorized boundaries of the park unit. These maps, showing ownership and acreage, are the 'official record' of the acreage of Federal and non-federal lands within the park boundaries. While these maps are the official record of the lands and acreage within the unit's authorized boundaries, they are not of survey quality and not intended to be used for survey purposes.&amp;quot; As such this data is intended for use as a tool for GIS analysis. It is in no way intended for engineering or legal purposes. The data accuracy is checked against best available sources which may be dated and vary by location. NPS assumes no liability for use of this data. The boundary polygons LRD creates represent the current legislated boundary of a given NPS unit. NPS does not necessarily have full fee ownership or hold another interest (easement, right of way, etc...) in all parcels contained within this boundary. Equivalently NPS may own or have an interest in parcels outside the legislated boundary of a given unit. In order to obtain complete information about current NPS interests both inside and outside the unitsâ€™ legislated boundary, the tracts file created by LRD should be used in conjunction with this boundary file created by LRD.Available on NPS Open DataAbraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site, Acadia National Park, Adams National Historical Park, African Burial Ground National Monument, Agate Fossil Beds National Monument, Alagnak Wild River, Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument, Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site, American Samoa, Andersonville National Historic Site, Andrew Johnson National Historic Site, Aniakchak National Monument, Aniakchak National Preserve, Antietam National Battlefield, Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, Appalachian National Scenic Trail, Appomattox Court House National Historical Park, Arches National Park, Arkansas Post National Memorial, Arlington House - Robert E.
